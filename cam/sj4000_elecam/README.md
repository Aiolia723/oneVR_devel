<h3> Notes </h3>
SJ4000 and Elecam have the same dimensions so the mounts in this directory work for both types of cameras.

Rendered `.stl` files are to be directly printed on a 3D printer. To find a local 3D printer visit [3DHubs](https://www.3dhubs.com)
<p>
Use `.scad` files in [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org) (Free) to modify dimensions to match camera type and other aspects of camera mount. Render to `.stl` when finished to print.
