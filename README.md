# One VR
<h3> An end-to-end VR solution concept </h3>
<br>
A virtual reality camera system along with a cross-platform (iOS & Android) mobile VR viewer application, forms an end-to-end VR solution; from capture to viewing.

<h3> Hardware </h3>
 * 6x SJ4000 action cameras
 * 3D printable circular camera mount
 * Standard Tripod
 * Relatively powerful GPU for image processing preferred

<h4> About the multi-camera system </h4>
Captures monoscopic video in 360 degrees horizontal and ~170 degrees vertical. Six individual streams are stitched and blended together into a cohesive panoramic video.

<h3> Software Component </h3>
 * OpenSCAD for rapid, parameterized prototyping of a 3D printable VR camera mount
 * OpenCV and C++ programming used for determining translations and relative positioning between video streams
 * Ionic Mobile Application Framework for rapid prototyping of a cross-platform 360 photo/video mobile phone viewer 
 * After Effects for rendering out all blended video streams as a large, cohesive rectangular .mp4 video

<h4> Mobile Application Description </h4>
Exhibit is a hybrid, cross-platform mobile application that explores the new and exciting virtual reality experience of viewing homes, apartments and new properties. With a few swipes, users can navigate an intuitive search feature and instantly find themselves standing in the room they want to see via photosphere or videosphere. Users can look around as if they're actually at the property which is made possible through the sophisticated use of gyroscopic sensors and projective geometry. For sellers, adding or modifying listings happens instantly and easily through a Parse database. From home owners to budding and mature businesses, Exhibit aims to bring the best places, to the best people, in the best way.
